Song Search Design Overview:
Cameron Flowers

An overview of my intended implementation is as follows: I want to implement
a hashtable containing word structs, which contain a word and a vector of 
wordfreq structs (each containing a pointer to a song and a frequency of appe-
arance of the word). Then the song struct contains a title, artist, and a
vector of lyrics. Using the hashtable I will be able to easily search for
the user selected string and find songs that match this particular lyric.
The hashtable search will make look-up time constant, and then by looking at
the wordfreq array I can easily determine the top 10 count of songs and the
necessary contexts of the lyric contained in the lyrics vector. 

I believe that this design makes sense given the ability to store and search
hash table elements quickly, and the use of the word, wordfreq, and song
structures will give me the ability to interact at these three levels of 
analysis and find the song title, artist and context quickly.
The use of a hashtable containing word structs themselves containing a wordfreq
array will make keeping track of multiple instances of a word across lyric and
song, easy to take care of.

I was given approval and assistance by TA Jackson Burzynski and have spoken
with other COMP40 Students and TA's.
